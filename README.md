# AndriodMyLibrary
App project for AND1

Description:
HomeLibrary is an app for people who want help organizing their many books or readers who want help keeping track of the many books they read or both. 
I am a part of both groups and have often struggled to keep a good overview of what I own versus what I have read.
In this app, you can keep track of which books who you own or want to, what you are currently reading, have read or have not read yet. 
You can add books to your library with the following information: title, bookcover, author, price, read status, owned status, rating, pagecount. You can upload images from your phone's gallery.
Your library has a filter function so you can search based on the information you have given about the book. 
Furthermore, in HomeLibrary, you can seek inspiration to expand library or your reading list. You just enter a keyword for what you are seeking: e.g. android, tolkien or non-fiction
and the app will list some books that matches your search criteria.
