# AndriodMyLibrary
App project for AND1

My project is about organizing one's home library. When I was a bit younger, I was a digilent reader and book-buyer. To such an extent that I owned so many books that I think it technically qualifies for a library. I would have loved to have an app so that I could organize my books and get a quick overview of my collection; which ones I had already read, the onces I hadn't read, what did I think about the book, for how much did I buy for and etc. 


Requirements:

1. As a user, I want to be able to register and change a book(title, read status, review, rating, price, cover, ownership) because it is useful information to store.
2. As a user, I want to be able to have a 'currently reading' status for one or more books where I can set what page count I have read until because it helps me be motived to continute to read.
3. As a user, I want to be able to upload or take a picture with my phone to store a book's cover because that is the most convinent for me.
4. As a user, I want to be able to register a book and have author, description, part of series, pages be autocompleted so that I do not have enter all the data already known about the book.
5. As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and delete profile because I want to be the only to change my library.
6. 5. As a user, I want to be able to login and log off because I want to be the only to change my library.
7. As a user, I want to be able to follow/unfollow or befriend/unfriend other users so that I can see which books they own, have read, their reviews and what they currently reading because I am interested in what others read.
8. I want to see my friends' libraries because I am interested in what they read.
9. As a user, I want to be notified my friends either upload a review or their reading progress because I want to be able to follow their reading habits.

*I think nr 4 can be done through Goodreads' API*
